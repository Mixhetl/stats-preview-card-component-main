## My process

Hey. This is my first official Frontendment practice.
Make the decision to do this exercise using only HTML, CSS.
Make the layout only using sections and div, trying to put into practice the good practices that I have learned throughout my study.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the classes and the id correctly, although the project was not perfect.
In the next project that I carry out, I will surely be able to improve the use of these concepts.
I also managed to create my first CSS Grid layout something I had a lot of respect for...
Now I am more confident than before. I'll continue practicing.

### Continued development

My next projects will also be from Frontend Mentor. I plan to do all the free exercises under this scheme, that is, using only HTML, CSS and Javascript. If the projects advance in complexity I will go on to use React or Vue.
